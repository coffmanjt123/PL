Sample programs

This one is the only one that will work as intended 
1) (A 50 by 40 [north wall -> B]) (B 30 by 30 [south wall -> A]).

The rest will parse correctly but will not give desired output
2)(A 50 by 40 [north wall -> B]) (B 30 by 30 [south wall -> A] [east wall -> C]) (C 5 by 5 [west wall -> B]).
3) (A 50 by 40 [north wall -> B]) (B 30 by 30 [south wall -> A] [east wall -> C]) (C 5 by 5 [west wall -> B] [south wall -> D] )(D 20 by 5 [north wall -> C]).
